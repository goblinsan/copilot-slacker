 *  - Ensure VITEST flag set so code can branch appropriately for tests.

// Keys we allow tests to mutate; everything else reverts to baseline.
// We track differences dynamically so new env vars don't leak.
// NOTE: Original implementation restored the entire environment after each test to the baseline.
// This caused problems for multi-step integration tests that rely on values set in a file-level
// beforeAll (e.g., SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET used to sign multiple Slack interaction requests across
// several `it` blocks). Clearing the secret between tests led to 400 bad_signature responses on
// subsequent steps. To preserve deterministic behavior for those flows while still avoiding large
// uncontrolled mutation, we no longer auto-restore after every test. If a specific test mutates
// global environment variables in a way that could affect later files, it should reset them
// manually. We retain this helper (currently unused) should we want a manual restore in the future.
